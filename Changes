Changelog for ResourcePool

V1.0000 - 2003-01-02

  *  From this release on, the ResourcePool package will not contain 
     resource bindings anymore. The previously included bindings for 
     DBI and Net::LDAP are available in the ResourcePool-Resource-DBI 
     and ResourcePool-Resource-Net-LDAP packages on CPAN. 

  *  Applied patch from James G Smith which introduced the is_created 
     method to ResourcePool::Singleton. This does not change the 
     behavior of any ResourcePool module. 

V0.9910 - 2002-11-25

  *  The runtime overhead introduced by ResourcePool and LoadBalancer 
     has been reduced. Depending on you configuration this release 
     has up to 35% less overhead. 

  *  Fixed a bug in LoadBalancer's documentation. The Weight 
     parameter works only for the LeastUsage policy. 

  *  A general code cleanup has been done to gain the performance 
     benefits. 

  *  Added tests for LoadBalancer. 

V0.9909 - 2002-10-07

  *  A refactoring of the Singleton behavior of ResourcePool::Factory 
     makes it possible to implement nicer factories 

  *  Adopted ResourcePool::Factory::Net::LDAP to have a more native 
     interface. 

  *  Fixed links within the POD documentation (was broken for some 
     pod2html translators) 

  *  Added documentation for Net::LDAP bindings which were lost in 
     the previous release. 

V0.9908 - 2002-09-30

  *  Added documentation: ResourcePool::BigPicture, ResourcePool::UML 
     and ResourcePool::ExtensionGuide 

  *  Changed Net::LDAP factory to accept the bind parameters in the 
     same way as Net::LDAP expects them. 

  *  Added tests 

V0.9907 - 2002-08-30

  *  Fixed a major bug in Net::LDAP bindings which was introduced in 
     V0.9906. Every LDAP connection was believed to be broken when 
     handed back via free(). 

V0.9906 - 2002-07-10

  *  wrapped DBI calls into eval{} blocks to make RaiseError aware. 

  *  It's possible to pass the options for ResourcePool and 
     LoadBalancer using a Hash reference. 

  *  added tests 

V0.9905 - 2002-07-05

  *  A rollback() is performed on DBI sessions with AutoCommit 
     disabled when they are free()ed. 

  *  free() and fail() for ResourcePool and LoadBalancer return 
     meaningful values. 

  *  added tests 

V0.9904 - 2002-06-04

  *  Implemented the SleepOnFail option for ResourcePool and 
     LoadBalancer. 

  *  Fixed typo in Net::LDAP bindings which caused incomplete error 
     reporting (thx to Sean Welsh) 

  *  Fixed many typo's in the documentation (thx to Florian 
     Helmberger) 

  *  Greatly improved and extended the documentation. 

V0.9903 - 2001-10-15
