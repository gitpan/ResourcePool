=head1 NAME

ResourcePool::Command::Exception - An Exception for L<ResourcePool|ResourcePool> commands.

=head1 SYNOPSIS


 
 
 eval {
 	$pool->execute($cmd);
 };
 
 if ($@) { # an exception happend
 	my $ex = $@;
 	my $rootException = $ex->rootException();
 	my $nofailed = $ex->getExecutions();
 }

=head2 S<$ex-E<gt>rootException>

This method returns the exception which cause the execute to fail.

If the execution was started more then once (e.g. because of the MaxExecTry setting) this method returns the exception which occurred during the last attempt.


=head2 S<$ex-E<gt>getExecutions>

This method returns the number of executions done before the exception was propagated to the client.

This is usually 1 for L<ResourcePool::Command::NoFailoverExceptions|ResourcePool::Command::NoFailoverException> or equal to MaxExecTry for other exceptions.
