ResourcePool - A connection caching and pooling framework

Copyright (c) 2001-2002 by Markus Winand <mws@fatalmind.com>

See COPYRIGHT section in the ResourcePool(3pm) manpage.

Recent Changes
--------------
  *  The runtime overhead introduced by ResourcePool and LoadBalancer 
     has been reduced. Depending on you configuration this release 
     has up to 35% less overhead. 

  *  Fixed a bug in LoadBalancer's documentation. The Weight 
     parameter works only for the LeastUsage policy. 

  *  A general code cleanup has been done to gain the performance 
     benefits. 

  *  Added tests for LoadBalancer. 

Installation
------------
    ResourcePool is a pure perl implemented module and should 
    therefore run everywhere where perl is already installed.

    The well known procedure is:
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install 

Examples
--------
    Are included in the manpages which come with this distribution.
    The ResourcePool::BigPicture(3pm) manpage is the right point 
    to start to get the overview, after that feel free to visit
    the ResourcePool(3pm) and ResourcePool::LoadBalancer(3pm)
    manpages.
