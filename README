ResourcePool - A connection caching and pooling framework

Copyright (c) 2001-2003 by Markus Winand <mws@fatalmind.com>

See COPYRIGHT section in the ResourcePool(3pm) manpage.

Recent Changes
--------------
  *  Applied a patch from Chad Redman which is basically the same as 
     the patch from Eric Parusel which was partitially applied to 
     1.0102. This time I applied the patch to the correct CVS branch 
     *argl*. 

  *  Minor corrections and improvements in documentation. 

Installation
------------
    ResourcePool is a pure perl implemented module and should 
    therefore run everywhere where perl is already installed.

    The well known procedure is:
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install 

Examples
--------
    Are included in the manpages which come with this distribution.
    The ResourcePool::BigPicture(3pm) manpage is the right point 
    to start to get the overview, after that feel free to visit
    the ResourcePool(3pm) and ResourcePool::LoadBalancer(3pm)
    manpages.

Resource bindings
-----------------
    To do something usefull with ResourcePool you will need 
    resource bindings. There are some bindings available for
    download from CPAN. Those bindings live in the
    ResourcePool::Resource namespace, for example the Net::LDAP 
    binding has the name ResourcePool::Resource::Net::LDAP, if you 
    can not find the required bindings, please consult the 
    ResourcePool::ExtensionGuide(3pm) manpage for details how to 
    create one.

    Available bindings on CPAN (as of 2003-02-27):
       Net::LDAP
       DBI
       SOAP::Lite

    The Net::LDAP and DBI bindings where included in the ResourcePool
    core package in all 0.99xx versions of ResourcePool. Since
    release 1.0000 they are no longer included in this package
    and have to be installed seperately.

How to contribute?
------------------
    Submit patches for bugs you discovered (or report the at least), 
    upload your own resource bindings to CPAN.
