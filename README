ResourcePool - A connection caching and pooling framework

Copyright (c) 2001-2002 by Markus Winand <mws@fatalmind.com>

See COPYRIGHT section in the ResourcePool(3pm) manpage.

Recent Changes
--------------
  *  A refactoring of the Singleton behavior of ResourcePool::Factory 
     makes it possible to implement nicer factories 

  *  Adopted ResourcePool::Factory::Net::LDAP to have a more native 
     interface. 

  *  Fixed links within the POD documentation (was broken for some 
     pod2html translators) 

  *  Added documentation for Net::LDAP bindings which were lost in 
     the previous release. 

Installation
------------
    ResourcePool is a pure perl implemented module and should 
    therefore run everywhere where perl is already installed.

    The well known procedure is:
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install 

Examples
--------
    Are included in the manpages which come with this distribution.
    The ResourcePool::BigPicture(3pm) manpage is the right point 
    to start to get the overview, after that feel free to visit
    the ResourcePool(3pm) and ResourcePool::LoadBalancer(3pm)
    manpages.
